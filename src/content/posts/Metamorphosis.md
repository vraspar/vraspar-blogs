When I read Metamorphosis, it made me think about the complexity and fragility of relationships and how our closest and most valued connections change when life takes an unfortunate turn. The tragic transformation of Gregor Samsa into a bug and his family's reaction to this transformation led me to examine the conditional nature of our relationships and the expectations we have of one another. One thing that stood out to me was the idea that "everyone will betray you." The story made me wonder if the people who are supposed to be close to us will stick around when things get tough. Would they forget all the sacrifices we've made if we become dull or ugly, like Gregor did when he turned into a bug?

On the other hand, the book made me realize how easy it is to let go of relationships when they get difficult. It's crazy how quickly we can forget everything a person has done for us when they don't meet our expectations or become a burden. The abandonment of Gregor by his family made me question whether our relationships are based on superficial aspects, such as appearance and convenience, rather than on deeper connections and commitment. How unconditional is our loyalty when times get rough?‚Äù

So, what can I take away from Metamorphosis? The story encouraged me to reflect on my own actions and attitudes towards the people in my life. Well, I guess the main lesson is that we should value empathy and loyalty in our relationships. We should remember the sacrifices our loved ones have made for us and stick by them even when things aren't perfect.
