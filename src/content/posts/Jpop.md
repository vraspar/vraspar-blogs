## ðŸŽµ J-pop

For those who don't know, J-pop is a genre of music that originated in Japan. It is characterized by its catchy melodies, upbeat tempo, and colorful music videos. J-pop has a wide range of styles, from pop to rock to hip-hop, and has gained popularity around the world.

Here are some of my favorite J-pop songs:

1. [**"Pretender" by Official HIGE DANdism**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ8WlA2GXbk)

    This song has a catchy melody and heartfelt lyrics. It's a great song to listen to when you're feeling down.


2. [**"Lemon" by Kenshi Yonezu**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SX_ViT4Ra7k)

    This song is a beautiful ballad with emotional lyrics. It's a great song to listen to when you're feeling nostalgic. It comers the bitterness of lemon to the pain of facing, and accepting a loved one's death.
